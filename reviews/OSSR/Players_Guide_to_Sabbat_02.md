_I think they meant inside the group rather than inside the individual members of the group._

Your musical accompaniment will be [Leaders of Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEO2TFW1DZ4) by Joy Division because the book suggests that you listen to it.

#### AncientH:  

> The Sabbat has very firm beliefs concerning all outsiders. Its members are known for their distinct separation of everyone into "them or us." To the Sabbat, all non-Sabbat are "them," regardless of whether "they" are vampires, Lupines, mortals or whatever. The Sabbat does have a few allies, but the sect cooperates only to a limited degree, and only when it is to the Sabbat's advantage.

Basically, this is the best way to be an asshole. Also, it's not hideously different from any other Vampire or supernatural groups. It would take a while for relations to get a little more muddled so that someone from group A could deal with someone from group B without attacking on sight.

It gets weirder the farther you go in: the basic premise is that the Antediluvians are real, and they're coming to eat us all. Which gives us gems like:

> What is truly unbelievable is how most other vampires outside the Sabbat do not even believe in the Antediluvians.

The sad part is it's not like the Camarilla drank the kool aid as much as the _writers_. I would have been cool if the Antediluvians had remained a legend, which would have added some fuel to the fire of the Sabbat as a medieval death cult. Then there's the Anarchs...

> The anarchs have been blinded by their elders' lies and thus see the Sabbat as a terrible evil that must be stopped. How stupid can they be? They do not even take the time to listen, so they refuse to learn the truth.
> 
> The anarchs see themselves as rebels. The Sabbat sees them for what they are - part of the establishment.

1) The Sabbat just admitted that they treat everyone that isn't Sabbat like shit, and 2) I think the Sabbat are vampire hipsters.

#### FrankT:  
We open with the Sabbat perspective, and the Sabbat perspective is apparently complete fucking gibberish. The most important thing to do is to have all the younger vampires stop fighting each other and join up to fight the eldest vampires when they wake up in the upcoming Gehenna – this is why the Sabbat spend all their time fighting vampires who aren't members of the sect and refuse to have open dialogues with other vampires. That is _obviously_ how you'd go about stopping an opponent you believe is working to keep younger vampires “disorganized and ignorant.” Now my eyes hurt from rolling too hard.

There's a box about how the Sabbat reject the Masquerade and “raise hell in the mortal world” and vampires in general and this sect in particular are still a secret because... um... they just _are_, OK?! You're not the boss of me! This premise is so hard to buy into that they made a piece of box text just to try to sell it, and I'm not buying. No White Wolf product has ever managed to explain how the Masquerade could continue to be a thing if there was a large sect of Vampires who openly flaunted it that has been around and doing that for hundreds of years. This was the first Sabbat book and probably it's main job was to explain how the Sabbat could exist in a way that was consistent with the game world previously described. And the most important conceit of the game world is that the general public is unaware that there are vampire conspiracies. That conceit is totally incompatible with there being vampires who raise hell and flaunt their vampirism as a regular thing who control entire cities. This book crashes and burns on page two of Chapter One.

#### AncientH:  
The Sabbat's views on the various independent clans and other supernatural groups is weird even if you keep in mind that it's 2nd edition. For example, they don't think the Children of Osiris exist, that the Followers of Set are evil and must be destroyed, that the Giovanni aren't a big deal, the Ravnos are a powerful clan, the Tzimisce have an alliance with a group of Magi, and they're divided about the Assamites. No word on the Changelings, which is probably for the best. Really, the Sabbat's approach to the other vampire groups isn't very different to the Camarilla's perspective.

tl;dr: The Hentai Club is mortally opposed to the Anime Club.

![https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b3/c9/e5/b3c9e58d33fa6616de666fb0fe6c7fee.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b3/c9/e5/b3c9e58d33fa6616de666fb0fe6c7fee.jpg)  
_Then we get to the pretension titles._

#### FrankT:  
Early Vampire books all had lexicons. Later ones often did too. White Wolf authors thought they should make up a bunch of words.

![https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fiction_rule_of_thumb.png](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fiction_rule_of_thumb.png)

Looking back at this, it's interesting to see which of these words actually entered use among Vampire players and subsequent authors. Like the original Vampire, many of these words never caught on and I had forgotten that anyone tried to make them be a thing.

![https://www.mememaker.net/static/images/memes/4098347.jpg](https://www.mememaker.net/static/images/memes/4098347.jpg)

So people referred to ranks of Sabbat members like Priest and Bishop (although I didn't remember there being multiple bishops in a city, that seems like dumb rank inflation), but I can't recall anyone ever talking about Ignoblis Ritae. While nothing is ever going to be as egregious as “Jyhad,” the crimes against English committed by this book are also quite risible. They want us to use the word “siege” to mean _conquering_ a city rather than _attacking_ a city – which is just not what that fucking word means and what the actual fuck?

#### AncientH:  
The Catholic religious terminology applied to the Sabbat is just _weird_. I want to think they were going for a kind of Black Mass/mirror of the Catholic Church as an organizational principle; it kinda-sorta serves as a counterpart to the Camarilla use of the term "Prince" and the like, so you can have people talking about the Archbishop going against the Prince and you're not going to be confused about which faction is which, but honestly the approach to religion by the Sabbat is mostly lip-service. Like, technically they all take the _Book of Nod_ literally, but you don't get the impression that the Sabbat actually pushes the religious angle heavily except with the terminology and the fervent hatred of the unbelievers. Like I said, all fucking Southern Baptists at heart.

That said, there is a sidebar on the titles:  

> The Sabbat uses many titles derived from those of Catholic church officials. There are good reasons why the Sabbat chose those titles. First of all, the name of the sect itself shows its contempt for the Inquisition and the witch hunts. Also, some Sabbat vampires actually managed to create alternate identities as church officials to steer the Inquisition away from the Sabbat and point them toward the Camarilla. The titles were kept by many after the brunt of the Inquisition died. Other Sabbat vampires began to use the titles, and they eventually came to denote actual positions of leadership.

This would almost make sense if they actually worked out a backstory for the Sabbat that wasn't insane.

Also, this:  

> Headhunter - A Sabbat vampire who collects the skulls of vampires he has destroyed.

Kindred collapse into ash when you kill them, dumbass!

#### FrankT:  
The Sabbat is smaller than the Camarilla but has more different clans in it. The actual reason for this is obviously because the Sabbat was written later when more clans had been written up. Now a very good question to ask at this point would be “So what?” I mean, there was nothing written in the original Vampire book that suggested that you couldn't be a member of another clan and still be a member of the Camarilla. The unit of account was the Coterie (a group of vampires roughly the size of the group of players playing the game), not the clan. In fact, some of the core clans are defined by _not_ caring about clan structure (Brujah, for example), and the only clan presented as even having clan leadership that a player character would be expected to listen to was the Tremere. So you'd think that White Wolf would have done up their expansion clans as “these are clans whose members only infrequently are seen in the ranks of the Camarilla outside certain regions in Africa or Europe” or whatever. But that is not what they did. Instead they wrote up all the expansion clans as dudes who were _never_ in the Camarilla, despite the fact that that makes it very difficult to play the fucking game.

Anyway, written as it was after the first wave of explosive clan expansion had been done, the Player's Guide to the Sabbat promises a spot for almost every clan that had been so far written up. That's Lasombra, Tzimisce, Assasmite, Gangrel, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Panders, Ravnos, Serpents of the Light, Toreador, Tremere, and Ventrue. That's 13, and they don't include Giovanni but do include Caitiffs as a clan. A bunch of those clans have “_Antitribu_” at the end of their name and that is fucking dumb and what the actual fuck?

This is the first formal attempt to reconcile all the shifting accounts of what clans exist and compile it all into a list you could actually play. Also Steve thinks that some of the basic clans aren't cool enough and gives the Sabbat version the option to take disciplines that he likes better. This all boils down to the fundamental issue that Vampires don't actually get enough powers in Vampire: the Masquerade and people were constantly trying to squeeze more blood from the stone. The main solution should have been to just give out more powers, and the Sabbat book agrees, giving every Sabbat vampire an extra dot to start with. Which isn't going near far enough, but is a step in the right direction.

Then it throws that good will down the toilet with its section “The Structure of the Sabbat.”  
[quote=Player's Guide to the Sabbat]The Sabbat is not a very structured sect.[/quote]

![http://cf.chucklesnetwork.com/items/1/0/7/3/8/2/original/so-much-rage.jpg](http://cf.chucklesnetwork.com/items/1/0/7/3/8/2/original/so-much-rage.jpg)

There is a rant about how titles don't have consistent meaning in different areas, which is probably a preemptive excuse for why the titles aren't used in any consistent way in this or future books. But it's fucking exhausting is what it is. The explanation for why they use ecclesiastical titles is pretty lacking. It's supposed to have something to do with having fought the inquisition a few hundred years back, but um.... _what?_ I had remembered it as being because they started in pre-enlightenment Europe and they adopted church structure because that was the social system of the time. Because that is a totally reasonable and sufficient explanation. But it turns out that was a later retcon and the original explanation was much much stupider than that. In any case, there are equivalent ranks to all the various positions in Camarilla society because of course there are, plus a few more, and the end result is that the demographics of the Sabbat are completely fucked. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.

#### AncientH:  
The Sabbat basically has two clans: the Lasombra and the Tzimsce, and then a bunch of _antitribu_ - i.e. Sabbat factions of the various established clans. This was more important before the game entered the Final Nights, and you can kinda see how a few vampires defecting from the Camarilla to the Sabbat could start up their own bloodlines just kind of naturally. _And that is interesting_, and could have been pursued further, but they don't do that.

![http://img06.deviantart.net/b2fe/i/2015/137/8/7/vampires_masquerade___sabbat_by_rednicotine-d8tqx41.jpg](http://img06.deviantart.net/b2fe/i/2015/137/8/7/vampires_masquerade___sabbat_by_rednicotine-d8tqx41.jpg)

Also, Steve cannot keep his goddamn terminology straight:

> Brujah Antitribu: The Brujah of the Sabbat are almost exactly like the Brujah outside the sect. While Brujah are considered rebels by the Camarilla, the Sabbat Brujah are part of the establishment. The Brujah antitribu hate the Camarilla more than any of the other clans, but try the hardest to convert anarchs to their side.

Yes...the anarchs that a couple pages ago you dissed as being part of the establishment. Which is it, Steve? Are the Sabbat the establishment or anti-establishment? This was, of course, before they came up with the True Brujah, because the Brujah antitribu weren't cool enough.

As much as the Sabbat claims to be different from the Camarilla, it really _isn't_ for most practical purposes - all of the Sabbat clans are concerned about looking rebellious while basically following the same social structures and prejudices as the Camarilla clans. Members claim to be "inhuman," but they still paint others as "evil" which is really weird; it's like the serial killers, rapists, and cannibals refusing to associate with the necrophiles because that's a step too far.

Like Klingons, the Sabbat has a practice of settling political disputes with one-on-one combat. Which I generally approve of; it's stupid and it leads to some of your best people dying, while your top levels get choked full of whoever is best at hand-to-hand combat.

![https://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server3400/v4eyu8t/images/stencil/original/products/1576/2627/Klingons_Sparkle__87193.1431094366.jpg?c=2](https://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server3400/v4eyu8t/images/stencil/original/products/1576/2627/Klingons_Sparkle__87193.1431094366.jpg?c=2)

Then there are the Loyalists. These are sort of like the Soviets who actually believe in Communism, and would argue about things instead of following orders; the Loyalists believe in the ideals of the Sabbat (whatever those are) rather than blind loyalty to the regent/cardinals/archbishops/bishops/abbots/etc. Today, they'd be the Tea Party Sabbat.

![http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2756/4094534002_c5c432e6f3.jpg](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2756/4094534002_c5c432e6f3.jpg)  
_Let's never forget that the Tea Party is full of racist assholes._

#### FrankT:  

> The Sabbat has its share of assassins in addition to the Black Hand.

There are a lot of wheels within wheels in this book. It's not as insane as Dirty Secrets of the Black Hand, but you can definitely see how that book got where it did. The core issue is that the vampire demographics described in the original Masquerade are unworkable garbage, and none of the later books really had the courage to walk that shit back. The presented vision was one in which the United Kingdom had more Members of Parliament than it had vampires. And that means that the whole idea of there being sects within sects and secret assassin units and other different assassin groups and regional leaders and councils of advisers and shit is completely insane. The West Midlands region has 28 MPs for Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton, and surrounding villages combined. Assuming that's collectively the size of a Sabbat region, and we have an Archbishop and Bishops and Prisci and Palladins and Black Hand members and an Abbot a Regent and a Consistory Council and shit, there really isn't room on the force organization chart for anyone who isn't in upper management or elite strike forces. When you hold your Palla Grande there are only twenty people there and they are the folks you meet every other night, so the masks are pretty pointless.

Honestly, the demographics issue is the number one problem of Vampire in general – the numbers are way too small. But the Sabbat is worse about this than the Camarilla because they are supposed to be smaller and have more nomadic packs and neonates relatively speaking. So the demographic numbers were already impossible but they are being squeezed from both ends.

#### AncientH:  
There is a Sabbat Inquisition.

![https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e8/1c/fa/e81cfa642631232d644e69452fa95262.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e8/1c/fa/e81cfa642631232d644e69452fa95262.jpg)  
_No one expects the Sabbat Inquisition!_

Nominally, this is an internal secret police to stamp out the Path of Evil Revelations, one of the new Paths of Enlightenment introduced in this book that is especially attractive to Diabolists. Because murderdeathkill is cool and fun, but the Sabbat draws a line at dealing with demons and (apparently?) diablerie. However, there's only 15 of them. Well, "only." In Sabbat demographics terms, that could be as many vampires as there are in most mid-sized cities.

Then we finally get a bit of Sabbat History.

> Long ago in Europe, a great panic erupted among the vampires. After centuries of relative peace between kine and Kindred, the ignorant peasants were ignited by the fire of the Inquisition to destroy all that they deemed  
> supernatural. The old vampires had grown complacent and proved to be no match for this new threat. Because most of the Methuselahs feared Final Death, they sacrificed their childer for their own survival. Due to the strength of the Blood Bond, there was little these young Kindred could do other than rush out and meet death head-on.

That would be cool if there was absolutely anything in any other product to back it up, but...yeah, not so much. Later products largely ignored this history.

#### FrankT:

OK, White Wolf history is always pretty WTF at the best of times. The Sabbat history is pretty messed up even by those low low standards. The basic concept is that the Inquisition was waging war on the supernatural so the Elder vampires sent younger vampires to die in battle with the inquisitors and then a bunch of Spanish younger vampires went around doing a children's crusade to die in battle against the Inquisition. But in a totally free and independent way and not at all exactly like being ordered to go fight the Inquisition by their Elders in the first place. And then the Elders got super pissed that these younger vampires were fighting the Inquisition because they wanted to instead of following their orders to go fight the Inquisition and.... what the fuck?!

![https://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/story_main/public/migration/PriMigrationsDamanticWordpressAttachmentsImagesMigration/www.theworld.org/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000014408016Medium.jpg?itok=BWvsJxTp](https://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/story_main/public/migration/PriMigrationsDamanticWordpressAttachmentsImagesMigration/www.theworld.org/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000014408016Medium.jpg?itok=BWvsJxTp)  
_Don't even try to figure out what this has to do with the actual historical Inquisition. As far as I can tell, White Wolf authors learned everything about the Inquisition from Monty Python sketches._

Anyway, this led to people figuring out a magic ritual to break blood bonds, and then there came the Anarch Revolt, which seems to have mostly been the Anarchs doing the things they had been ordered to do earlier, but now _for Anarchy!_ And this _really_ pissed the Elders off, and this escalated the conflict even higher and there were spies and betrayals and big battles and all kinds of other things that don't make a lick of sense considering how few vampires there actually are. A bunch of Elders got killed, mostly by Assamites and various vampires joined the Anarchs (not the Assamites) because of that. Anyway, elders from seven clans formed the Camarilla and went to war in earnest against the Anarchs (not the Assamites) and what the fucking hell?

Anyway, the Anarch revolt was put down and most of the Anarchs surrendered, but some of them didn't and formed the Sabbat to continue war with the Camarilla. And that's why tonight the Sabbat, the Camarilla and the Anarchs are three different groups that all hold territory. Wait, what? 200 years later, the Sabbat would decide that they needed an ethical framework and some rituals and an organizational system and stuff like that. And this part of this book's history didn't stay canon very long because the entire Dark Ages line decided that the paths of enlightenment predated the Camarilla instead of being a new innovation that came after hundreds of years of Camarilla-Sabbat conflict.

There were various squabbles inside the Sabbat over factional differences and I don't think any of this shit stayed canon for long either. I suspect this is because I'm already bored of reading the Sabbat history shit and I'm more patient than a typical White Wolf author and I'm actively trying to read this book. We are also told that the Camarilla controls the majority of North America despite the fact that it had previously been established that the Camarilla had been forced out of three of the largest North American cities (New York, LA, and Ciudad de Mexico) and had pretty much ceded the entirety of rural America to the dog fuckers. I know these guys really care a lot about Chicago and Atlanta, but by mileage or population the Camarilla is objectively getting its ass kicked, so all the other books claiming that today's flavor of the week is an underdog to the Camarilla in America has always been very weird.

> **Austria**  
> The Sabbat practically does not exist in Austria.

Austria is a postage stamp with the population of Dallas. Who fucking cares whether the Sabbat exist in Austria? Why does that get a headed paragraph? What the actual fuck? And then it goes on to say that there are a few packs of nomadic Sabbat members in Austria, which is very much the opposite of practically not existing because the entire vampire population of Austria is supposed to be like 75 vampires. So if there are at least two packs, that means that about 20% of the vampires are Sabbat members. I genuinely don't think the author understands that Vienna is about the size of San Antonio or Orlando.

> **Scandinavia**  
> The Sabbat of Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg and Denmark are different from most other Sabbat. The sect is still strong in this region, but it makes no effort to increase its power except in Amsterdam.

![http://static.tumblr.com/jhhfv1l/uEWm0zhps/fym2.png](http://static.tumblr.com/jhhfv1l/uEWm0zhps/fym2.png)

Where to start? Is it that Luxembourg is on the French border and not by any possible stretch of the imagination in Scandinavia? Is it that Amsterdam is in Holland and not in any of the named countries? Is it that Finland, Estonia, and Iceland exist? Fuck. Start anywhere. Then look at a fucking map, like these clowns should have done while writing this piece of shit.

#### AncientH:  
One thing that strikes me about re-reading this history after, oh, at least a decade is how _simple_ it is. You'd really expect vampires to have a lot more factions - I mean, above and beyond the clan level, which is sort of a natural "unit" of vampire-dom insofar as you can trace back whom-sired-whom and have similar powers and weaknesses and shit. It would, eventually, get complicated as Dark Ages and 3rd edition came into their own, but it was still pretty much: Camarilla, Sabbat, Inconnu (who nobody cares about), and Anarchs (who nobody cares about). Also, large parts of the history just don't make sense with the presentation of the Sabbat so far:

> As soon as a leader claimed power, he was challenged by other power -hungry vampires. Soon factions began to develop and wage war on other Sabbat, both within their own territory and in other cities. The Black Hand was shortly the only element of the Sabbat to remain somewhat intact, though it had its own problems. The schisms made it that much easier for the Camarilla to gain control of many of the Sabbat-held cities. The internal conflict waged from the mid-1800s through the 1930s. Since that time, the Sabbat has become a little more structured, but is far from being organized or having a strict hierarchy.

Look, Klingon Promotion (mistakenly associated with Darwinism in the text) helps a lot with maintaining a fluid hierarchy on something resembling a meritocratic basis, but the older vampires probably hit harder and live longer so they rise to the top anyway; and the Sabbat's hierarchy seems just as fucking rigid as the Camarilla's. So this is less "descent into gangland style conflict" to "that's not what you said three pages ago." Then we get to the Sabbat Today, and back to nomenclature problems:

> The most important of all Sabbat activities is the subversion of Camarilla influence. The Sabbat was founded on the principle of rebellion and today the establishment is the Camarilla. The Camarilla controls the majority of North America and virtually all of Western Europe. Believing its mission to be a sacred one, the Sabbat has decided to reestablish its dominance on the North American continent.

Again...none of this has been established. The book goes back and forth between calling the Camarilla the Establishment and the Sabbat the Establishment. The "sacred mission" really hasn't been hammered out except for rabid xenophobia of anything that isn't Sabbat.

So basically, the Sabbat book contradicts itself at every fucking turn, and a lot of it just...doesn't make sense.

#### FrankT:

> If their Camarilla enemies protect themselves from mortals through the Masquerade, the Sabbat destroys the Masquerade.

Wait. What? How is the setting not destroyed at this point? That isn't some big future plan, that's just a thing the Sabbat do, in the progressive tense. The Masquerade gets destroyed, it's just a thing that happens sometimes. How the fuckity fuck sticks is there still a Masquerade fucking anywhere if that is a thing that happens?

![https://www.viralviralvideos.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/35235059-1.jpg](https://www.viralviralvideos.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/35235059-1.jpg)

I can't even evaluate the setting as described here, because the entire game is called Vampire: THE MASQUERADE™. If you tell me that actually the Masquerade has been a dead letter for hundreds of years and we're actually playing in True Blood or something more out-there than that because the great unmasking happened decades ago, what is there for me to hold onto?

This is like one of those surrealist discussions from the Simpsons where Bart or Homer just casually mentions that shit has been super weird for a long time and people just stare at them incredulously while they carry on earnestly and the scene moves on to another joke. But this is a fucking cooperative storytelling game, you can't _do_ shit like that. The first rule of improv is “Yes, and...” not “No, actually you're wrong and also none of the shit you talked about happened because there was a vital historical change decades in the past that you failed to consider, and...”

#### AncientH:  
The image of the Sabbat in the world is...piecemeal. This is because most of the World of Darkness hadn't been detailed yet, and wouldn't be for years. Some of the shit they _do_ talk about is hilariously stupid. For example:

> The Sabbat has almost no power in the West Indies. Sabbat pirates have long patrolled the waters of the West Indies, but until recently the Sabbat has had no interest in acquiring territory in the area.

![http://i68.tinypic.com/2w7jt4z.jpg](http://i68.tinypic.com/2w7jt4z.jpg)  
_Pirates? In the 20th century?_

> **United Kingdom and Ireland**  
> The Sabbat has been enjoying the state of confusion and dissent that has raped these magical lands of pride and unity among the Kindred. The Sabbat has sent a number of scouts to add fuel to the ever-spreading fire, but the sect as a whole is simply waiting to move in after the dust settles.

Raped? Really? On the other hand, if I had to make an Irish Sabbat vampire...

![https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9116/1519137-preacher03.jpg](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9116/1519137-preacher03.jpg)  
_Jaysis._

> Rumor has it that this powerful vampire has sought to unite the power of the Mafia and the Lupines with the Sabbat of Italy. No proof has been given and those who claim to have some tend to vanish very quickly. Sabbat leaders in America wonder if Giangaleazzo is working toward the betterment of the Sabbat or scheming to increase his own personal control over Western Europe. It is known to most Sabbat leaders that Giangaleazzo does not get along well with the Sabbat of Germany.

_World of Darkness: Mafia_ is a thing that would eventually happen. Not a good thing, but a thing.

> The Sabbat presence in Australia is small, numbering less than 40\. The Australian Sabbat are unique in that they select only their mortal kin as new recruits.

...I got nothing, that's just hilariously sad. There must be about three Sabbat in New Zealand, claiming that they aren't like the cousin-fuckers in Australia.

Africa and Asia are just jokes, because they've been retconned all to hell and gone with _Kindred of the Ebony Kingdom_ and _Kindred of the East_.

Now: Sabbat Ideology.

#### FrankT:  
So many tone deaf things to hate on. We got the perplexing piece of box text about vampiric disease. I work with disease every day. I have no idea how a disease would work that infected undead people. The whole concept really doesn't work that well because if regular bacteria and shit could infect vampires they'd putrefy exactly like a regular corpse. If they aren't alive, they shouldn't be subject to viruses at all. And so on. But this book casually discusses the idea that a third of the Sabbat vampires died of some sort of blood borne illness in the last fifty years. Which would be fucking insane.

Anyway, the list of Sabbat allies has the headings “Wizards,” “Native American Shamanistic Societies,” and “Voodoo Cults.” These have exactly the level of cultural sensitivity that you'd expect from White Wolf. And yet... at least it's _trying_ to be multiculturally inclusive.

![http://i45.tinypic.com/13ygfev.jpg](http://i45.tinypic.com/13ygfev.jpg)

And in the middle of a rant about how Sabbat vampires don't act human or interact with human society it casually mentions that they own corporations. Why would you own a corporation if you didn't care about the trappings of mortal society? It's literally just a legal entity recognized only within human law that entitles the people recognized by human society as its owners to have certain amounts of “money” which is unit of account in human society. If you're just going to wander around stabbing people and taking whatever you feel like, corporations don't even exist!

This book tries to sell me on the Sabbat vampires being post-human douche bags, but it can't even step outside the human condition enough to see that dollar bills have no meaning to sharks and bears.

#### AncientH:  
One of the interesting ideas for the Sabbat in this book - and thus one which was immediately abandoned - is that vampiric existence is _cyclical_ and that Gehenna is just the Kali Yuga. The elders rise and feed on the young, the strongest survive, and then they become the elders and the whole cycle goes on again. And the thing is, that could have _worked_ as an alternative to the Caine mythos. They could have pursued something like in nWoD where blood potency gets so high that the Elders can only drink the blood of other vampires, and periodically the Elders rise up and feast, with their childer scrambling to survive. If that happened every couple hundred years it would work out well. But they abandoned the concept. Not Christian enough, maybe.

"The Holy Crusade" is the Sabbat's battle for...North America. Because presumably that's where the bulk of their audience lives, and they are willing to fight and die the final death over Peoria, Illinois. The description of Sabbat tactics...doesn't work. I mean, however good you think the Masquerade is, tactics like mass embrace of people into Kindred to throw a bunch of cold bodies against possible enemies is loud, noisy, and probably unworkable - if they outnumber your enemy, they also outnumber _you_.

The description of Sabbat scout operations is also weird to me. There aren't so many vampires roaming around that a new guy showing up at Elysium or a random body washing up drained of blood won't go unnoticed, and if they claim to be Camarilla vampires they'll be expected to know people and it's like one phone call away from verifying any information they give out. So Sabbat spies should have much better cover stories than what is discussed here, is what I'm saying.

> When hunting humans for blood or sport, Sabbat will not hesitate to kill their prey. They love to drink victims to death and will even drink them dry when they do not need any blood. However, they usually kill only in cities they do not control. They know killing on a regular basis in their own cities would lead to trouble.

...and when we talk about the Sabbat and the Masquerade, this is the shit we mean. Don't shit where you eat. Even _wolves_ understand that.

The section ends with a brief mention of the Lasombra _antitribu_ and the Old Clan Tzimisce. Because nobody gets out of here without taking a drink.
