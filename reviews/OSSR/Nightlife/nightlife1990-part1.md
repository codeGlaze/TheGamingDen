### **Nightlife**

![](https://www.rpg.net/pictures/show-pic.phtml?picid=6643)

The year is 1990\. Well, I'm reviewing the "third edition" which came out in 1992, but Nightlife was frankly little changed in the new edition it came out with each year between 1990 and 1992, and the concepts and aesthetics are well and truly dated to their 1990 origin.

So it's 1990, vampires are cool, cyberpunk is cool, and D&D is a slowly dying whale. People are striking out with new mechanics. Whitewolf hasn't published Masquerade yet, but it's about to. It is an age of experimentation and fanboyism, and this all comes out plainly on the cover of Nightlife, which has the actual words on it:

NIGHTLIFE
The Role-Playing Game of Urban Horror

So let's get the mead and start reading.

#### **Table of Contents**

The first thing it gives you is a table of contents. The table of contents is almost useless because it is too detailed. It lists every single sub-heading in the book. Meaning that, for example, page 69 (which has the initiative rules on it) is listed in the table of contents seven actual times. To contrast, pages 61-63 are not listed at all because they have no subheadings on them - being "mere" continuations of the "General Skills" list that starts on page 60\. This system causes the table of contents to be three actual pages long, which makes it more like an index, but things are still just listed in the actual order they appear in the book and so it's not much use to anyone. You could seriously find anything in the book faster by just thumbing through the book until you found what you were looking for than by trying to figure out what it was called in the ToC. Especially as many of the subheadings are pretty much meaningless outside their context in the book (such as "The News" or "Mapping").

Then comes a one page story that is entirely in italics. I want to point out that yes, this is the format that Shadowrun adopted for its fourth edition in 2005\. Because Nightlife is in many ways way the fuck ahead of its time. The story itself isn't a bad opening, but the plain text introduction that follows it sure is.

The actual intro is four pages long. It has a "wat is role playing?" section, but before that it attempts to hook you into the splatterpunk genre. Because it's 1990, and people thought "splatterpunk" was a genre. For those of you too young or too sane to know what splatterpunk even is, it's basically a late eighties/ early nineties attempt by proto-hipsters to make grindhouse movies cool by enjoying bad gore special effects ironically. And of course, being really pretentious about it. It very unironically attempts to present a grand-unified theory of horror that, I-shit-you-not draws a line between Dracula, Hiroshima, Vietnam, and Night of the Living Dead to get to the supposed apex of Horror: Clive Barker and Lost Boys. I feel it very important to reiterate that I am not making that up. The authors want to underline that they are part of a cultural movement that is going to change the world by making and enjoying low budget horror films with very visible fake blood and teenagers dying on camera. Aside from all the batshit crazy, they do introduce a rather neat conceit, which is that the MC for this game is called the City Planner (CP). So the CP is literally the inverse of the PC, and represents one of the first games to effectively take the word "Master" out of the title of the MC and have that stick.

The mechanics of Nightlife are absolutely insane, but this is only hinted at in the intro. The intro informs you that it is helpful to have lots of d10s handy, and tells you that you are going to be summing them, dividing them, and using them to generate sequential digits in multidigit numbers. It also uses a hex map, and despite being set in a city, uses hexes that are five yards across.[quote=Nightlife, on hexes]Designate the distance across one hex to be 5 yards. Characters are considered to be in the center of the hex. This makes figuring ranges and keeping track of the exact location of characters very easy.

Yes, "adjacent" characters are considered to be fifteen feet apart. Because that makes keeping track of exact locations very easy. I need a drink.

#### **Character Creation**

Again, you get a little one-pager story in italics to help set the mood. These stories do a much better job of this than the rant about living in the moment through being a fan of objectively terrible horror movies. It gets off to a rather bad start in that the very first thing you do is to choose your race. You are going to be a member of "the Kin", which is what the game calls all supernatural creatures collectively. There are dozens of flavors of supernatural creatures (so many that any one you encounter is basically going to be a Steve). As a player character, your initially presented choice of race (there are a bunch more you can select from at the back of the book, and a bunch more you can't) is: Vampyres (yes, spelled with a Y, because fuck you), Werewolves, Ghosts, Daemons (spelled with an "ae" to... avoid pissing off Christians? I don't know), Wyghts (also spelled with a Y, because fuck you), Animates, and I swear I am not fucking making this up: Inuits. Yes, the Canadian First Nation people. Seriously. Drinking a shot is now required and I haven't even completed the first paragraph of the first real chapter.

Characters have Abilities (your stats), Humanity (which is another stat, but one which is even specialer than Luck and thus not categorized with the others), Edges (your magic powers), Flaws (your supernatural weaknesses), Skills (exactly what they sound like), a Personal Profile (a description and backstory of your character), Possessions (actual stuff you own), and Connections (think 1st edition Shadowrun contacts). Character generation has very large random components in it. You roll 4d10 and add them together and then apply racial modifiers to generate all your stats (except Humanity, which starts at 50). Then your skills are equal to your base stat plus a number of extra d10s that you assign to them from your pool of thirty (yes, 30) starting skill advancements. Stats are Strength, Dexterity, Fitness, Intelligect, Will, Perception, Attractiveness, and Luck. There are also derived stats of Survival Points (Luck + Fitness) and Hand-to-Hand Damage (Strength divided by 5), but these are not listed separately, they just happen to tell you that they have special systems to derive them in their text bodies. Luck goes up by a d10 every single adventure, but I think it maxes out at 100 (that is extremely not clear).

Humanity starts at 50, and the maximum starts at 100\. You can spend maximum humanity to increase your magic powers (which have numbers on them). Humanity is like a special morality gauge, and when it goes down you have a harder time passing yourself off as human. You lose it by eating people and otherwise being a cock. You get it back by doing trivial shit like interacting with humans. It bounces up and down a fucking lot. You can spend your maximum humanity to get new powers or improve the ones you have on character advancement, but you can also just do it at character creation. You know, whatever. To make assigning skill advancement rolls more complicated than it even already was, you assign a number of advancement rolls from your pool of 30 one skill at a time, and some skills have a requirement that you have a total value of 30 in certain other skills before you are allowed to select them. Yes, I think that means you can flub your advancement rolls on a prerequisite skill and then not be allowed to spend any on a specific skill you actually wanted. Because "busting" in chargen is awesome. The Connections is literally rolling on a chart to see if you start with less connections or more connections. If you get more connections you also get a couple of elite connections that are like mob bosses and investment bankers and shit. Because game balance is for people who aren't living-in-the-now.

Your Personal Profile is super important, and contains things that are actually game mechanically relevant like the faction you are associated with. This is the days before anyone learned anything from White Wolf, and the factions are supposed to fucking murder each other like Camarilla and Sabbat. The game suggests that characters in the same group should all be about the same in "their standing on pro- or anti-human beliefs, and their affiliations should reflect this." I am not making that up. Your Possessions are composed of a d10 times a thousand dollars in assets plus a hundred bucks per year of life. The Kin are immortal, so you can have as many possessions as you want by just writing an arbitrarily large age down. I think it is also important to note that the game explicitly tells you "Fashion is wildly important on the club scene of New York, and The Kin realize that chic dress is virtually a necessity."

#### **Races of the Kin**

Again, you get a story section. This is where they first come clean on the fact that the seven offered races are not the only races, but they tell you that it is up to the CP as to whether to allow you to play other races of the Kin. Spoiler: the CP section has the expanded list of kin types and literally tells you that some are playable and some aren't. I'm not sure how you could see the writeup of the non-standard kin you wanted to play without getting the information about whether you could play one or not - making the "ask the CP" step something of a formality.

There are 14 "Common Edges", which are powers that anyone can get. Some of them are powers that you start with (like Drain), and some are ones that you are allowed to buy. They include physical powers (Armor and Speed), magic powers (Weather Control and Aura Sight), and even flaw reduction (Photogenics is the "power" to be less limited by the "difficult to photograph" flaw that all members of The Kin have). But on top of that, every type of The Kin starts with completely arbitrary lists of powers, including a unique list of powers. Some of these powers are actually unique. Also they are all saddled with flaws, which are similarly completely fucking arbitrary. When your current Humanity is above 50, you take less damage from your bane items, and when it is below 50 you take more. Also various other stuff. Your Humanity is also your power points, in that it costs humanity on a daily (and sometimes individual action) basis to use your powers, and you get bonus Humanity for not using your powers.

I think it is also important to note that the various races of The Kin are extremely not balanced against each other. Not only do the stat modifiers not add up, there is as far as I can see not even a cursory attempt to make the starting or purchasable powers be vaguely comparable. To add insult to injury, some of the races attempt to sell you on a higher or lower starting Humanity as a selling point or disadvantage. This is fucking hilarious, because the actual example of tracking humanity for a character (spoiler: you do not actually get this information until page 143) has it going up and down by 18 points in an ordinary week. So starting with a Humanity of 40 or 60 instead of 50 is so amazingly not-relevant that it is hard for me to wrap my mind around why they would feel the need to even write that up. Even maximum humanity (the thing you spend to get super powers) is trivially easy to get, because every time you push your current humanity 10 points above your maximum humanity you trade that shit in. You can get up to 15 humanity per fucking day by simply holding a customer service job. You can max out all your powers by just having your character work at Best Buy for a few months.

And yes, one of the seven races of the Kin it wants you to play is named "Inuit". For serious. Also they are "the most flamboyant of the major races." It suggests that you be conservation and environmentally minded. Because the early nineties.

It should also be noted that the game totally goes off on feeding habits like all the time. Feeding is a special power that everyone has which allows them to brutalize people (or in some cases: animals) in some way to steal their life force in exchange for very small amounts of healing. This power is in almost all cases completely meaningless, as the amount of healing you get is bullshit and no one fucking cares. Some of the Kin races also starve if they go more than a few days without feeding, so they will obviously have to fit feeding on people or perhaps animals into their weekly schedule. But for the most part, it's a massive section of the rules that is almost 100% pointless.

#### **Edges**

Edges cost max humanity to buy. And they cost max humanity to raise their value. And some of them cost current humanity to use. Some powers are on a 100 point scale (where you roll a d100 against them when they are activated), and others are on a 20 point scale (where they go against d10s added together or d100s that have been divided by 5). Sometimes these have wildly different "cost ratios" (the amount of Edge Value you get for a lost point of humanity max or the amount of humanity max you have to spend for a point of Edge Value if the bigger number is on the other side of the division sign) to make up for this difference. Sometimes they don't. Powers are often incredibly redundant. There is a power called Aviary that turns you into a bird, there is also a power called Bat Form that turns you into a bat. They are right fucking next to each other, have completely different mechanics, and completely different costs. No one knows why.

There is a general rule that powers used on other Kin don't work well. Which is manifested by them getting -50 to their escape tests (that makes it easier for them to escape, by which we mean resist, so the power doesn't work as well). But many powers don't actually allow escape tests, which means that they work just fine on supernaturals. Also some abilities specify that they work fine on other supernaturals. Really, it seems like they could have just marked a couple of powers as not working well on supernatural creatures.

Normal humans are called "Herd", which means the same thing as "Kine" that were called in Masquerade, and Nightlife was printed first. So there's that. Humanity costs are incurred when you use powers that have humanity costs, but if you use them against a Kin instead of against a Herd, that cost is waved. I have no idea how that is supposed to work with things like Aura Sight that passively give you information about the people around you. Extra hilarity for having a Danger Sense power that you have to voluntarily activate and spend humanity to use that has a really short duration.

I think I need to point out again that there is really no commonality between different powers and the numbers attached to them. Many work if you roll under their value on percentile dice. But others are added as modifiers to other rolls. And some are divided by various numbers and then used as modifiers. Still others simply have their primary effect without checking the value at all and have their actual number you can buy up for humanity checked only in some obscure edge case.

#### **Flaws**

It is technically a chapter, so you get a little story vignette. It is a short vignette and it is a short chapter. The entire thing (story and all) is only 3 pages. It doesn't need to even be that long, because every race is enough of a Steve that they have to explain their Flaws in each racial writeup anyway. Like seriously: Vampyres need to sleep on a bed of earth, and the writers don't even try to pretend that that shit is categorizable.

Ugh. I have run out of booze and need to sleep. More laterz. We are only up to page 55.
