#### Random Monster Tables For Passages

Random encounter tables are so much a part of D&D DNA that most people don't stop to think _why_ they exist. It's not just because everybody likes to roll dice, although that's certainly a part of it: it's because the adventure is actually a _sandbox_, where the players are supposed to do their own thing. Now, it's not a huge sandbox - the various tunnels give a finite number of paths to move forwards, and the PCs are basically railroaded _into_ moving forward, insofar as no real options are given for saying "fuck it, let's dig for gold" or anything like that.

In practice, from a design standpoint, there's a lot of unspoken issues with the random encounter tables. To start off with, there are three: one each for Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary passages. They're all d20 tables. And they are unbalanced, but in different ways.

Case in point, the Primary Passage has, at the low-end, simple animals like Giant Slugs, 1-2 spitting snakes, and 5-6 fire beetles. These are critters a gang of six 9th-level characters should be able to confidently chew through, with the understanding that a couple crits or 1s could still ruin your day. On the high end, you might run into a rust monster, or 2-5 ghasts with 9-16 ghouls, or 1-4 trolls with 9-16 troglodytes, or 3-12 shadows, or 19-24 bugbears with 25-30 slaves. If you run into more shadows than there are characters in your party, and your party is not entirely made of clerics, you're fucked. You're super-fucked. You're basically dead. Even running into a small army of trolls is a bad day. Now, the actual chance of encountering those trolls is (1 in 10 chance of encountering a monster) (1 in 20 chance to roll a 10) (1 in 2 chance for it to be trolls or a gas spore) = 1/400, or 0.25%.

But then you realize you have to roll for every hex you go through, and there is a minimum of 39 hexes between you and the exit if you're going on the most direct route. So this isn't just a nice stroll to the center of the earth, you're pretty much guaranteed 3.9 random encounters, and a non-trivial number of those are closet trolls.

Then we get to the Secondary Passages...these are moderately safer. I won't say hugely safer. But your chances of encountering a wandering monster are only 1 in 12, and while there still are closet trolls, they aren't _literally_ a gang of trolls looking to play Seven Minutes In Heaven. So if any players broke the "referee eyes only" and were savvy with numbers, they'd map out a route that avoided the more traveled primary tunnels when possible, maybe.

But not the Tertiary Passages. Because while the chances of encountering a monster in the Tertiary Passages is also 1 in 12, the difficulty level...increases. Like, a 0.2% chance of encountering a lich or a vampire. I mean, if you're overleveled and want to troll the random encounters for loot, go have fun. But fuck that.

One thing about the tables is that they include parties of Drow and Kuo-Toa clerics/pilgrims/etc. that PCs can encounter. And these are all given generic condensed stat blocks, and also sub-tables to figure out what their bodyguards will look like. So if you see Mister Cavern rolling more than once, be afraid: because it's a 6-sided die, and there's a 20% chance of literal closet trolls, with added pointy-eared fuckbait on the side. (50% in tertiary tunnels when you encounter Drow.) Also, you get Drow Swag, which requires explanation:

>**Special Note Regarding Drow Cloaks, Armor, and Weapons:** All of these items have special properties, although none of them radiate any magic. The items are made under the conditions particular to the strange homeland of the Drow, for this place has unknown radiations which impart special properties to these cloaks, armor and weapons. When such items are exposed to direct sunlight a rotting process sets in. The process is absolutely irreversible, and within 2 weeks cloaks will fall to shreds, while armor and weapons become pitted and unusable. If items are not exposed to sunlight, they will retain their magical properties for 31-50 days before losing them, and if they are exposed to the radiation of the Drow homeland 30 or so days, they will remain potent. Items not spoiled by sunlight will eventually lose their special properties if not exposed to the special radiation, but they will remain serviceable as normal cloaks, armor, shields, swords, maces, etc.

Drow sleep poison decays instantly in sunlight. Its power is lost after about 60 days in any event, and the coating on the small bolts and javelins must be periodically renewed with fresh applications of the fungoid substance. The Dark Elves will often have small barrels filled with several packets of this poison, each sealed to insure the poisonous substance remains fresh for about 1 year.

Drow trash is sort of Gary Gygax's effort to introduce fairy gold. It's cool gear, and it's probably an improvement on the stuff you're actually wearing, but it isn't wealth that you can keep in any effective way at the end of the adventure. So totally use it, just don't throw away your old equipment when you upgrade, because seriously, that shit isn't going to last.

The Drow and the Kuo-Toa are both slaver races, and so there's random tables for what race of slaves they have. Which is cool, although I think there are inherent logistical difficulties in what you're supposed to do with said slaves once you presumably free them.

On the plus side, with greater challenges comes greater rewards: pretty much all the Drow and Kuo-Toa drop platinum pieces and gems as loot, so you're not hauling around a ton of copper pieces against your encumbrance limit.

For all that this is a sandbox and most of the encounters are probably going to be random running battles that echo throughout the strange dark corridors beneath the earth, there are set-pieces in specific encounter areas, and we'll look at those...tomorrow.
