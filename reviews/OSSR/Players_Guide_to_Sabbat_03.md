_There's a context for this, but meh... fuggit._

Music for this is [Public Enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqwYnVOQfrY). But not the important songs you've heard of like Fight The Power or 911 Is A Joke. Also not the big popular songs like Bring The Noise or Don't Believe The Hype. For whatever reason, Cold Lampin is the song we are treated to in this chapter. I think this is some sort of proto-hipsterism, where they are calling out the fact that they know the lyrics to third tier Public Enemy songs.

#### AncientH:  
"Running with the Sabbat" attacks one of the fundamental questions: how do you corral these vampiric cats? I actually addressed in a recent [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6o8w97/was_adventurer_in_the_dungeons_and_dragons_sense/) that the idea of _professional adventurer_ is very weird and kind of ahistorical concept. Normal people in the middle ages did not wander down to the local tavern and receive quests involving violence and loot from strange men. That is still not a thing that happens _today_ outside of Detroit and maybe Craigslist. The primary job of most vampires in Vampire: the Masquerade is...to be a vampire. The exact duties beyond that are _not_ well defined and very much arbitrary beyond night-to-night survival. How do you make money? _Do_ you make money? I mean, a lot of vampires unlive off-the-grid by necessity. And it's not like Shadowrun where the concept of "shadowrunner" had grown up which basically _is_ the professional adventurer class. So in any Vampire game, you really do have to ask not just what each vampire PC is, but what do they do, and why? What motivates them?

Now take all that, and remember that it applies mostly to Camarilla vampires, who aren't supposed to run around killing things noisily or waving their vampire dicks out in public. How do you then run a group of _Sabbat_ vampires, where that's basically the job description?

#### FrankT:  
One of the core problems of Vampire: The Masquerade™ as a game is the part where you want to actually start playing it. Like, in D&D you are a group of adventurers and then you meet up in a tavern and go adventuring. In Shadowrun you are a group of shadowrunners and you meet Mr. Johnson in a club and go on a mission. In Vampire... hmmm.... well that's a bit tricky. You're a vampire, and you're in a coterie of vampires. But the other vampires are almost certainly not in your clan, so there are fairly basic impediments to the player characters even knowing each other, let alone having mutual goals of some kind or cooperating in some endeavor to accomplish them. Vampire is thick with reasons why various characters would have difficulty working together, but explanations for how or why the player characters would be a group or share common goals are thin on the ground.

The Sabbat presents a much cleaner setup. You're a member of a pack. You all did some blood sex magic and now you are hyper-loyal to each other. Also the organization that did this to you wants your group to go do missions for them. And you know what? That's fucking fine. One guy wants to play a Nosferatu Luchador and another player wants to play a Toreador pretentious painter? Fine. Blood sex magic, you're a group now. [You fight crime](https://www.theyfightcrime.org/). Go fucking do it.

![http://rhcprock.free.fr/images/rhcp_band1.jpg](http://rhcprock.free.fr/images/rhcp_band1.jpg)  
_Sabbat blood sex magic is sugar free._

> A Sabbat vampire does not have much choice about the pack to which he will belong since he has no control over who chooses to Embrace him.

This is actually fine. More than fine. Everyone makes their own characters and then everyone becomes a vampire and is forced to join a pack and go fight crime together. That's a pretty good pitch. It's miles better than anything else that any other part of the World of Darkness ever figured out. Sabbat Vampires have literally the best backstory for why the player characters work together of any group in the World of Darkness. Or the New World of Darkness, for that matter.

The one narrative problem with this whole deal is that the explanations for how new players to the group would get to join the game or characters could get retired when players left the game temporarily or permanently are pretty strained. Packs probably shouldn't last for your entire unnatural life and should be a bit more fluid so that you could easily excuse new blood sex rituals when new players joined the game three sessions in. But aside from that issue, it pretty much perfectly matches the needs of the game. The book gives a feeble suggestion that you could actually still be in a coterie rather than a bonded pack, but now we're back to the regular Vampire problem of having 20 million reasons the different player characters couldn't work together or share common goals.

The big structural problem introduced by this Pack thing is that the book still wants the clans to be political groups, and that doesn't make any sense. A new Serpent of the Light doesn't spend any significant time being mentored in a Serpent of the Light cultural context. They literally crawl out of the ground next to a brand new Lasombra, Nosferatu, and Ventrue with no previous exposure to vampiric society. That's not a narrative problem, having a group of teenagers with different powers learning to get along and fight monsters is a fine setup that has worked for Power Rangers and Captain Planet and Chronicle and so on and so forth. But the setup means that the excuse for our new Serpent of the Light knowing and keeping any Serpent of the Light secrets or holding any Serpent of the Light specific political opinions is pretty damn thin. This doesn't have to be a problem, but the book _makes_ it a problem by refusing to drop the V:tM conceit of clan politics.

#### AncientH:  
It also doesn't help that according to the intro chapter, the Sabbat doesn't like or trust the Serpents of the Light and thinks they're all evil Setites and will have to be destroyed eventually. Which is really weird when you consider that a not-insignificant number of Sabbat packs will have Serpents of the Light in them.

I like the pack _angle_, but it's a bit weak in the actual fiction; solo NPCs often work better than small groups of NPCs, because you don't have to split the screentime/page count among different people. That's why when you get group superhero films, you tend to have _one_ main villain, and maybe a dragon or lieutenant. For example, in _Dracula_ the main bag guy is the Big D, and it takes an occult investigator, a psychiatrist, a real estate agent, and a Texan with a big fuckin' knife to team up to stop him. For the Fantastic Four, the villain is Dr. Doom - or sometimes the Mole Man. You don't see the Frightful Four on screen in the movies for a reason; grudge match-ups are hard to do. Even in wrestling, they generally limit that to tag-team matches.

![http://mblogthumb1.phinf.naver.net/20130223_128/zaq0132_1361604288920KogHz_JPEG/gangrel.jpg?type=w2](http://mblogthumb1.phinf.naver.net/20130223_128/zaq0132_1361604288920KogHz_JPEG/gangrel.jpg?type=w2)  
_This is Gangrel. He is a professional wrestler. Who shops in the women's department._

So while the pack works for the Sabbat in the streets, it tends to fall apart as you move up the chain of command and things start to get populated by NPCs. So the packmates are loyal to each other, but not necessarily to their nominal boss or other packs, and the same is true. There is nothing stopping two Sabbat packs from having a pissing match, or for an archbishop to randomly order you to go on a suicide mission against a Giovanni zombie factory. This is something closer to the soviets of the old USSR than anything else, with the soviets bucking against the Party. To top it off, the potential lack of clearly-defined "pack leaders" can get dicey for moments of indecision.

#### FrankT:  
Where the book's presentation of the Sabbat character motivation totally loses me is the Ambition vs Loyalty thing.

> All Sabbat put their sect before themselves and everything else in the world. They know what will happen to them if they do not.

This, to put it bluntly, doesn't make a lick of sense. Fear and loyalty aren't the same thing, and putting sect first out of fear of personal consequences is actually putting yourself first.

![http://i.imgur.com/dSIYbpd.gif](http://i.imgur.com/dSIYbpd.gif)

More broadly of course, the whole Pack bonding thing makes for a pretty good reason why the group hangs together, but it doesn't _particularly_ offer any insight into why the player characters would want to follow the teachings and orders of some Regent in Ciudad de Mexico. Like, I get why you're a super team of vampire ninjas, but I don't get why you suddenly are fanatically loyal to a religion you hadn't even heard of before last Tuesday.

Like many books from White Wolf, the Player's Guide to the Sabbat blithely assumes that organizations have seemingly limitless resources to spend hunting traitors and defectors. I don't know how that's supposed to work. They don't have limitless resources for anything else, they are supposed to be an underdog faction. They have nomadic packs that don't make contact with any leaders in Sabbat cities for decades at a time, if a Sabbat pack moved to Portland, Atlanta, or San Diego and joined the Camarilla or the Anarchs or something, who would even know? And even if they did find out, and called a war party against Atlanta, how is that different from what the Sabbat would do anyway? They are already dedicated to invading Atlanta, what fucking difference does it make if they are pissed off about defectors?

Mostly this just seems to be a preemptive temper tantrum over the fact that players might want to play characters from this book in other parts of the setting. Like, obviously you're going to want to play Sabbat bloodlines and former Sabbat members because _fucking obviously_. Even if that wasn't strictly superior game mechanically for a number of character types, and even if that was the only way you would be allowed to both play in the usual sorts of Vampire games and _read this fucking book_, it was just obviously a character concept people would want to play. So having Steve play the Gygaxian fun police and tell you that hordes of dudes will come and kill you for no good reason if you try to play these character concepts is just really odd. It's the kind of thing that seemed like a total dick move when Gygax did it in 1979, and it didn't feel any less out of touch in 1992.

_But it will end in tears regardless, you're playing Vampire._

#### AncientH:  

> The Sabbat provides protection, freedom and loyalty to all its members. These gifts are not without their costs. The members are required to protect sect interests, carry out missions and to give the Sabbat total fealty and devotion. Sabbat express this devotion in their packs.

The Sabbat viniculum is _basically_ supposed to be like the brainwashing you get from joining a cult, where your individual interests are seconded to furthering the cult's goals. This is like drinking the kool-aid, but with more protein.

![http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rtOXMZlMTkg/S_H4Veg6CSI/AAAAAAAADNw/DRrZWgoDY6I/s1600/killaid.gif](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rtOXMZlMTkg/S_H4Veg6CSI/AAAAAAAADNw/DRrZWgoDY6I/s1600/killaid.gif)

Mechanically, there isn't a good way to represent that. It's important to remember that each individual vampire is basically a serial killer, and the more of them you have in a given area the higher the chance is that they'll be discovered. It's just a lot easier to hide three bodies a month than it is to hide six bodies a month. In practice, a lot of this is handwavy - if the player didn't want to play the game, they can take their character and leave at any time. But the book emphasizes the _fanatical devotion_ aspect rather than player individuality, so the Sabbat which promises "freedom" feels a lot more like an abusive relationship than magically-enhanced camaraderie.

You also get the start here of _extra-Clan relations_; or bonds that can tie vampires together outside clan affiliation...in this case, the sect, the pack, and the Path of Enlightenment. They liken the Path to a religion, which they followed through with more heavily in Dark Ages with the _Ashen Priest_ sourcebook and various Road splats, and while Paths of Enlightenment are inherently terrible I think it was a sincere attempt to start to give vampires from different clans/bloodlines reasons to not kill each other and interact like grown ups. It's like how an Irish/Mexican marriage can work as long as both families are Catholics or Satanists.

_Being in the Sabbat isn't all about fighting Klingon duels to the death. It's also about training up teenage suicide bombers._

The Fun and Games section is probably where the book jumps the shark. It talks about how Sabbat vampires do stupid dangerous and extreme shit like they were the villains in a xXx movie. Street racing, shooting each other in public for “fun” and all kinds of stupid crap with corny nicknames to show how hardcore everyone is. Basically this section reads exactly like it was originally written for [Nightlife](http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=53763), which honestly it may well have. Nightlife of course predated Vampire: The Masquerade™ and it was best known for a more in-your-face Poochy the Dog style vibe. So having this book introduce more shit like that is just the game going back to its roots.

Those roots happen to be jumping on a dorm bed playing air guitar.

_The roots._

A bit later we get into a basically equivalent list that is much less gonzo in the form of various Sabbat rituals they do. Some of those are things that I actually remember people talking about Sabbat members doing, most notably the fire dancing thing. There are still a lot of misses in there, and even while I'm literally reading and reviewing the book right now I can't tell you which activity is “Blood _Bath_” and which is “Blood _Feast_”. A lot of this is edgelord tryhardism is what I'm saying. The rituals are divided into various categories (Ignoblis and Auctoritas), but I don't care. The hit rate of these activities isn't high. Between the games and the various rituals, I think maybe one in three are things that actually permeated the consciousness of players and future authors as thing Sabbat members did. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone in any game or sourcebook claim leadership of a pack by dint of taking on a Test of Pain. That is not and was not ever a real thing.

#### AncientH:  
A lot of the rituals don't work because 1) there are no stats for any of this shit, 2) you can't safely LARP it, 3) utter confusion over what constitutes a "ritual" and _ritual_, and 4) some of these are amazingly stupid. Examples!

> * Gangbanging: The Sabbat ride past Camarilla Kindred and fill them full of lead. Seldom do they kill the enemy vampires, but this game stirs up a lot of trouble among mortals, especially when the guys they supposedly killed get up and stumble away.
> 
> * Headbanging: The pack members go into the mosh pits of clubs, work themselves into a frenzy and begin tearing people up and drinking blood. The only reason any mortals survive this is that the frenzied Kindred often attack each other . This is a terrible game to play in one's own town, but it can lead to wonderful escapades when played in a Camarilla Rack.
> 
> * Horse Racing: The Sabbat will often race horses just as they race cars, except they can take the horses places cars cannot go - shopping malls, hospitals and grocery stores, for example.
> 
> * Human Gladiators: The Sabbat often capture a few humans, equip them with knives, clubs and chains, and make them battle each other. The Sabbat tell them the survivor gets to keep his life. Whether or not this is true is up to the pack, but most are enjoyed as post-game meals.
> 
> * Spirit Games: A Sabbat pack with Thaumaturgists who know the proper magic summons a spirit and asks it questions. This is similar to using a Ouija board, but much more spectacular - and dangerous.
> 
> * Torture Games: Sabbat often find the suffering of others most amusing. They take kine and Kindred "performers" to their communal haven, where they test the individual's pain resistance.
> 
> * Trick or Treat?: Sabbat often go door to door trick or treating, even when it is not close to Halloween. If they are not given candy by the people inside, they usually "trick" them by sneaking in and drinking their blood. Sometimes they play silly pranks instead.

This is the _Lost Boys_/_Near Dark_ type of shit, only much stupider and more juvenile. Using your illusion powers to make somebody think their fried rice is maggots is a cute prank; going into a bar and starting a fight so you can kill everyone in a frenzy is something a psychopathic vampire might do. But none of them are exactly traditions that encourage group play.

And the fuck is up with the trick-or-treat thing?

#### FrankT:  
The Player's Guide to the Sabbat tries to have its cake and eat it too with regards to Caitiffs. Your character is one of a group of new vampires that was created collectively by some other vampires from various bloodlines and you don't really have much contact with them specifically. The vampire whose blood literally runs in your veins is like the heroin addicted mother who gave you up for adoption. Except of course you're a vampire, so they are also that creepy dude you ran into at the bus station who beat the shit out of you and took your bus money.

And yet, the book wants us to believe that “The Lasombra” represent some sort of individual faction. I have honestly no idea how that's supposed to work. But because it basically fails to sell me on the idea that anyone in the Sabbat should give half a shit about what clan anyone is from, all their discussions about what it means to be clanless in the Sabbat are just puzzling. Whatever parallel clan hierarchy is supposed to exist doesn't make any sense, so people being excluded from it also doesn't make any sense. It would be like Irish Americans getting into fights based on historical Irish clans, but actually makes less sense even than that because at least Irish Americans have some sort of continuity to the previous generations.

_There's not actually a point being made by showing the Arch Enemy singer, I just want to do it._

#### AncientH:  
Actually, Irish Americans in the early 20th century routinely got into pissing matches with Northern Irish Americans, especially after the establishment of the Free State, but I digress.

> The recruiting of humans for the Sabbat is handled by all True Sabbat. The True Sabbat are sect members that have proven themselves in combat.

True Scotsman jokes aside, you can see how _Dirty Secrets of the Black Hand_ happened when you read this book.

The Sabbat Creation Rites are hazing rituals that new vampires go through [s]to make them strong[/s] [s]weed out the weak[/s] for lulz. They are loosely inspired by the practice of the Parisian vampires in Anne Rice's _The Vampire Lestat_, which was obviously a major thematic influence. This is shit like burying the fledgling vampire and seeing if they can dig their own way out. It's kind of stupid and shits on vampire character creation a bit, but whatever. It's still less stupid than what the Baali had to go through. Even if you're leaving another sect to join the Sabbat, you still have to go in the ground first.

_This works a lot better with Potence._

#### FrankT:  
We've complained about Blood Bonds in Vampire: the Masquerade™ before. Fundamentally, they don't work narratively. Vampires _should_ want to drink your blood. Having blood drinking be an act of submission by the dude doing the drinking is kind of missing the whole point. You're not a predator, you're a cocksucker. Look, vampires are supposed to be dominant over humans because they feed on them. Fucking hell, do I have to draw you a fucking diagram? This basic failure to make Blood Bonds be a thing that successfully reinforced vampire tropes is a big problem that permeates V:tM at pretty much every level.

The Sabbat have replaced all that with the previously mentioned blood sex magic. Everyone gets in a circle and pours their essence into a cup and drinks from the cup. And that really sounds a lot like a euphemism for homoerotic frat games when I say it outloud. Making it a group activity makes it a lot less off-theme, since of course everyone is bleeding and drinking you don't have the problem where predation is an act of submission. So the Sabbat Vaulderie is much more on-theme than the regular blood bond rules.

![https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/64/57/2b/64572b62a7311bca8bb15a0902eb3d2e--fred-durst-limp-bizkit.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/64/57/2b/64572b62a7311bca8bb15a0902eb3d2e--fred-durst-limp-bizkit.jpg)  
_Also a reference to circle jerking._

For reasons apparent to no one, the Sabbat make it really hard to join the sect. The rest of the book rants about how they are always trying to infiltrate other vamp organizations and get converts and shit, but perhaps the author suddenly realized that player characters might actually want to do that in order to get access to sweet Sabbat magic powers and gave us a rant about how it's super hard to join. That is not how cults work!

#### AncientH:  

> The lust for vampire blood is strong within the Sabbat. Diablerie is condoned, with the Methuselahs outside the sect as the main targets. Packs of Sabbat gather into groups known as War Parties to hunt specific elders. The challenge is to see which pack, if any , gets the elder first. A War Party may consist of any number of packs, but two or three is the most common number.

Vampire eventually kinda-sorta frowned on munchkins that wanted Moar Powah! and kinda-sorta played directly to those same munchkins by printing sourcebook after sourcebook of Moar Powah! The traditional route of improving yourself as a vampire was to earn XP and use that to raise skills, attributes, disciplines, and backgrounds; that was fucking expensive and meant a huge investment in time. _Or_ you could commit diablerie, which was "forbidden" but... well, forbidden fruit tastes sweetest. Especially if you bought powers that gave you _more_ power out of diablerie.

Anyway, this is a long way to say that a "war party" to assassinate an elder is actually a thematic Good Idea; it even works if the PCs get too big for their britches and _become_ the elder. Of course, because this was Vampires in the 90s, they have to be culturally insensitive and stupid like they were eight year olds in 1960 playing Cowboys and Indians:

> The chief of the War Party offers the participating packs the challenge. The chief chooses the target and reveals the target only after the  
> packs have committed to the hunt. A pack can back out if the target is exceptionally dangerous, but doing so humiliates its members. The object is to steal some of the elder's blood but, almost always, the elder is also destroyed. Wagers on the outcome are made between the packs and individuals; the most common bets involve the performance of services for the winner. The participating packs take the War Path the following night. Most vampires even paint their faces with war paint while on the War Path.

#### FrankT:  
Sabbat Justice is that people in positions of authority torture or kill you or both whenever they feel like it. There's way too much ink spared on this.

#### AncientH:  
There really is. While I can appreciate that the gist of this chapter was to try and provide a distinct Sabbat culture, a group culture marked by regular and irregular rites, taboos, practices, etc. that players could sink their teeth into, I think it really fails on a couple levels...because the Sabbat are just a bunch of fucking hooligans. They're not fighting a war in the shadows with the Camarilla, they're just a bunch of bloodthirsty assholes on a gap year. It's like being in a fraternity where occasionally the alumni give you some money and tell you to go on a panty raid like "the good ol' days." When we think of war today, we think of guerrilla warfare, terrorism, a loose cell structure that's impossible to destroy - and that is something that the Sabbat _could have been_, a sort of vampiric resistance against the Camarilla. But that's no fun to play, apparently; they'd prefer vampires play trick-or-treat or read sermons aloud from the _Book of Nod_.

I mean, when you _really think about it_, the numbers game on the Sabbat vs. the Camarilla is bullshit in the first place. Vampires aren't limited to the native population of their member states or the birthrate; they _control_ the birthrate. When the Sabbat wants to make up the numbers, they just do mass embraces. That is a tactic that they do. If the Sabbat wanted to have as many vampires as the Camarilla, they could do it _in a couple of nights_. The reason they don't is...I dunno. Control, probably. It takes a while to really inculcate the Sabbat/vampire ideals into recruits and train up their powers to be useful - a lot of investment in time and effort and blood, especially if you have to stare at the asshole for the next thousand years. But no-one did the hard math on any of that; the Sabbat looks like it is because they have to be the edgelordy underdogs compared to the Camarilla - because if they were equal or superior in numbers, they'd just be The Man.
