>#### Encounter Area A2-31

Sorry for the delay on this one, got home after work yesterday completely knackered and slept through to the next morning.

>Use encounter piece V when this area is reached. Describe the multitude of openings available to the party, and indicate that this area is faintly lit by the glowing lichens and phosphorescent streaks of mineral in the walls of the passageway. They will not see any creatures or hear any noise, but there are 8 Deep Gnomes (as described previously under random encounters) watching them from hiding. If the party stops and searches the area-or calls out in friendly terms-the Svitfnebli leader will show himself and offer the peace sign, recognizing the party as creatures from the upper world. He will converse in sign language, or speak normally if some magical means of communication/understanding is available. If the adventurers offer not fewer than 1,100 g.p. gem per Deep Gnome, and agree to going "halfies" on any others taken, the Svirfnebli will certainly agree to accompany the party to the shrine cavern.

Aside from the dick move of assuming the PCs can't detect the Deep Gnomes, what are the odds that a random humanoid approaches you underground making strange gestures and you don't attack? Also, how do you communicate "halfsies" in rudimentary sign language?

The Deep Gnomes are hereditary enemies of the Kuo-Toa and Drow, and having finished mining out a vein of gems, are now willing to join forces to raid their foes for more. So...basically, they want to go a-viking with you. The leader is Trosli Garnetgetter, who can summon a big-ass earth elemental once a day, but doesn't want to do it because he's a stingy bastard.

_3/20 chance of rolling a xorn!_

>Each of these Svitfnebli has a small tablet compounded of special minerals which restores 4 hit points of damage, while their leader has a full dozen extra of these curatives. Trosli Garnetgetter also has a pouch containing 6 large stones which shatter and release an obscuring gas (15' diameter cloud, 10' high) when smashed by hurling against a hard surface, as well as 4 yellowish rocks which release poison gas in a similar cloud when smashed.

This is all stuff that would have been nice if it was standard equipment. I mean, it's okay if you can't buy it at character creation or on the surface, but this is the kind of incidental bullshit that's just sort of...forgotten. Pops up in adventures and then is never mentioned again ever.

From here, we go straight into the **Shrine of the Kuo-Toa**. This is a straight-up dungeon crawl, albeit a dungeon with hallways and armed guards and shit. [url=https://www.glendale.org.uk/blog/20160605_shrine_of_the_kuo-toa]Map for the curious.[/url]

The flavor text is worked directly into the description, so you get entries like:
>ENTRANCE TO THE LOW CAVITY: The paw is met by a chilling scene when first they step far enough northwest to view the dimly lit space ahead. Greenish phosphorescence from lichens, coupled with a grayish luminosity from slug-like creatures as large as a man's fist which crawl everywhere (walls, ceilings, floors) give the area an undersea appearance, and a strange salt tang is in the air to enhance this impression. Directly to the north the adventurers will see a huge dark green creature, rather like a giant lobster-headed woman, with one pincer raised and the right extended ahead and open. This stone idol is detailed at 4\. below. The walls and pavement of this place are well-made, but very worn. Obviously, this area is old. It feels alien and foreboding. The shape of the stones and the illumination of the area are
wrong to any creatures from the upper world, particularly warm-blooded ones. A glance left and right will reveal the archway to the west and the 20' wide, 40' high opening leading east.

At this point, the most interesting bit is:
>At this point any intelligent creatures observing the paw will ignore it. This is a place where traffic is not uncommon, and those entering are permitted to approach the shrine and make obeisance to Sea Mother, obtain the required "passes", and move on. (See 3\. below.) The shrine community is organized only with respect to its guards and heirarchy. not its pilgrims or passersby.

Yeah...this isn't an abandoned temple to a forgotten god out in the boonies. It's a pilgrimage site on a well-trafficked underworld trade route, and the fucking Kuo-Toa operate a tollbooth. This is a bit like wandering into Ellis Island and trying to bust the place up. I'm genuinely not clear on what the PCs are expected to do here, because starting a straight fight with the guards seems like a really bad fucking idea, even with their gnome commando allies. Maybe you're supposed to reconnoiter a bit first? Send the thief in, let them map the fucking place or something.

>Blibdoolpoolp, pronounced Blibbb - doool - pooolpp

Also, they repeat this a couple times, just so you get the fish noises down right, but they still left it as "Barrracks" through multiple printings.

As is pretty typical for Gygax, some considerable thought went into the low-probability possibilities of this adventure. For example, if your party reaches the Idol:
>Blibdoolpoolp's name is carved into the base of the statue in Kuo-Toon characters. If the extended left claw is grasped while the individual stands upon the altar, and her name is pronounced correctly (Blibbb - doool - pooolpp), the creature is immediately transported to deep waters of the plane where Sea Mother holds court. (If the individual cannot breathe water, he, she, or it is immediately in Blibdoolpoolp's debt for having the goddess save the individual from drowning by magic spell.) The individual coming before Sea Mother must offer the goddess from 10,000 to 60,000 g.p, value in pearls, or double that amount in gems, or risk the wrath of Blibdoolpoolp. She will grant a small favor to the individual making an offering, and then return the individual to the altar before her idol. Those without offerings are **geas/quested** not to harm or cause to be harmed or aid in the harming of any worshippers of Sea Mother. They must further contribute 60,000 g.p. value in gems to the shrine (or bring in a number of Drow whose combined levels equals 1/100th of the g.p. value for sacrifice-Blibdoolpoolp hates the Dark Elves, but cannot oppose their patroness and other helpers directly!). The individuals are then returned to the altar, with the ability to speak Kuo-Toan and marked secretly so that all the Kuo-Toa People will recognize one in the service of Blibdoolpoolp.

This is probably the _secret best case scenario_ short of straight up genocide or a party of thieves ripping the temple off blind, since you're going to be defiling the shrine anyway, and this way you end up on the Special Kuo-Toan No Murder List _and_ get to read/write/speak Kuo-Toan _and_ it advances the story by giving you further reason to go get some Drow! Hell, I'd probably have some wilely old Kuo-Toa Monitor get the PCs to do it anyway - worse comes to worst, the Sea Mother eats them.

If the PCs go too far into the shrine complex, they run into the throne room of the Priest-Prince Va-Guulgh, which is guarded by 6 Kuo-Toa priest-assassins who are 6th-level clerics/6th-level assassins. That's not a good day for anybody, but if the PCs do win the priest-prince has some sweet loot

_Look, whatever you do, don't talk about his facial tendrils._

There's also the slave quarters, for if the PCs that want to play Spartacus.
> The western room holds 3 gnolls, 1 half-orc, 2 hobgoblins, 2 lizardmen, 9 orcs, and 8 trogs. The eastern chamber contains 2 dwarves, 3 Deep Gnomes, and 21 humans (one ofwhom is a 7th level paladin with 175, 141, 16W, 17D. 17C, and 15Ch - H.P.: 60). All slaves are fairly well acquainted with the normal parts of the shrine cavern, especially the orcs and Deep Gnomes. Freed slaves will happily kill Kuo-Toans; whether or not they will help liberators directly is a function of alignment and treatment as well as initial reaction

>The large room to the west is a standard torture chamber, with the usual rack, iron boot, chains, irons, etc.

"Standard"? Is this just a part of the building code? "Yeah, we have to have one full bath for ever four rooms, a kitchenette, and a torture chamber with the standard appliances."

While nominally a "shrine," this place is really a small Kuo-Toa community in full Dwarf Fortress mode with its meditation chambers, training rooms, breeding pool ("This is where the Kuo-loan females lay their eggs, and the males then fertilize them with milt. [...] There are presently 4 females and 11 males spawning."), fingerlings pool, royal spawning pool ("Only the ruler of the shrine area and his concubines may use this pool"), royal fingerling pool, guardroom, seraglio ("The 6 concubines of the priest-prince dwell here. They are indolent and pampered, and they will not fight."), guard quarters, armory, storage chambers, secret passages, and an impressive library (1,786 various folios, scrolls, books, and collections in Kuo-Toon and Drowic). The library has a secret compartment hidden in there with...ah, let me spoil it.

> Inside this nook are stored a map of the shrine area (which does not show the secret doors and adits!) and a black iron box. The box is locked and cursed with a plane shift which will move the first creature touching it to the Elemental Plane of fire unless the word **sloolbpah** is pronounced. Inside the box are a Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms, a Manual of Gainful Exercise, a Tome of Understanding, and a Grim Grimoire (a nonesuch work which will cause the loss of 20,000 experience points from any reader except a thief or assassin - a thief gains or loses nothing, but an assassin will gain 1 level of experience from reading and pondering its contents for 1 month). As all of these works are scribed in Kuo-Toan, reading them might be troublesome ...

...which is really just a fuck you wrapped inside a mystery, inside an enigma, inside a burrito that will send you to the Elemental Plane of Fire if opened.

Also, not present: kitchens, stables, bathrooms (!) - c'mon, at least the slave quarter needs a Little Drow's Room - etc. The usual things that are quietly left out of set-pieces and dungeons.

While I would find it hilarious if the PCs seduce the Priest-Prince's harem or something, what the PCs are probably hoping for is to find and break into the secret treasure-room which only the Priest-Prince knows about, which is filled with trapped treasure chests full of the wealth of decades of offerings and taxation. More than the PCs could plausibly carry forward on the next stage of their journey unless they had a couple _bags of holding_.

Also, subplot: the Kuo-Toa are holding a female drow 9th-level fighter named Derinnil in durance vile (torture is scheduled next Tuesday, apparently; maybe they want to have the slaves give the iron boot a good polish for their guest). Because of course the Kuo-Toa trust the Drow about as far as they can sacrifice them to the Sea Mother. Derinnil, for her part:

>She will volunteer to aid and guide rescuers, but she will, of course, betray them at first opportunity.

_I know exactly how I would play this._

But to even get to her you have to kill or bypass a shitload of fishmen cleric/assassins, so maybe not the top of the priority list.

>**FINAL NOTE TO DUNGEON MASTER**

If you are using this module as a part of the whole campaign, be certain to keep a careful note of all that the party does. You can do this by writing on the margin of this booklet. Any opponents which escape attack by the party will give warning to their masters or fellows if possible-particularly Drow, Kuo-Toans, and their more intelligent servants. However, the chaotic nature of the Dark Elves precludes the chance of organized search for the party. so at best the Drow will be aware of intruders and more watchful and suspicious. The Kuo-Toans are not numerous enough to mount a major search effort.

If the party is moving on to the next module, cease play in this one as soon as they pass into one of the northern tunnels, and begin with the next package.

THIS ENDS THE SECOND SECTION OF THE DESCENT INTO THE DEPTHS, SHRINE OF THE KUO-TOA

That being said, there's still like nine more pages left. Honestly, this is very sandbox-y: you've got a shitload of rooms, guards, and treasure, and the PCs are left to their own devices. If they're clever (or just pay the goddamn toll and move on), they could be through this place in a couple hours, a few hundred g.p. the poorer.

As a dungeon, the shrine is...well, I hope you somehow levelled up coming to this place, because the Deep Gnomes' scooby snacks are _not_ going to cut it.

_Next up: Whatever's left._
