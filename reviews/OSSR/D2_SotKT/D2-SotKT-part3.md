# [OSSR]D2: Shrine of the Kuo-Toa
_As reviewed by: Ancient History_
## Part 3

**Ancient History said...**
>No details are given for how to handle any of the random encounters. It's not like D&D3 where they gave power-up suites for encounters. The only real guidance we have is:
>Note that encountered monsters will act/react with intelligence and organization commensurate with their mentality and social development. This is especially applicable with respect to the ancient race of KueToa People (also detailed fully in a separate section at the end of the module), who have a highly structured and complex society within their shrine area.

#### Encounter Area W27

The first set-piece is where the PCs cross the Svartjet River; it is 80 feet deep and the sole barge allowing passage is poled by a large rogue Kuo-Toa who is "quite chaotic and a bit insane."

_PCs: "How insane?"
MC: "He is not housebroken."_

>Heis 13th level for purposes of attack and saving throws. He moves at normal monitor speed (18”) and attacks 4 times per round (2x4-10, 2x2-5 biting), always to kill. Thoopshib may be unbalanced, but he is very sly. Normally, any creature acquainted with his service will whistle or call for service, pay a fee of 1 p.p. (or its equivalent),and be ferried across. The solitary Kuo-Toan does not care who or what he transports. If the barge is threatened or attacked, he will leap into the Svartjet and summon his only companion, a giant gar over 30 long with AC 2 and 65 hit points. It stays just upstream from the crossing area, and if it is urged on by Thoopshib. It has a
I5%/round chance of upsetting the barge. The gar will bite for 7-28 h.p. of damage 80% of the time anyone is in the water there, 25% if walking on the water, and only 10% if levitating or flying up to 20‘ above the water.

This is actually pretty typical of later set-piece encounters, where the specific combination of tactics and environment come together to create a unique challenge for the player characters. They do not, of course, _have_ to fight the Kuo-Toa, who is just as fucking happy to take their money and do his job. But provisions are made for if the PCs want to kill him (and his pet) and steal his shit. I admit some of the finger points of this encounter are lost on me - why don't the PCs just swim, or cross somewhere else, or whatever. Fording is generally out of the question given the depth. The Kuo-Toa is, of course, on the other side of the river initially, which puts him out of the range of most of the PCs' magic and ranged attacks and sneak attacks.

>The noise of the river will mask normal sounds from the hearing of the Kuo-Toan, but bright light in the cavern will certainly attract his attention. He will come forth and offer in the common speech of the underworld to take the party across for the proper fee each. Each time he repeats this offer (and it will not be understood by the party without magical aid or an interpreter), he has a 10% cumulative chance of going berserk and attacking.

Just so people are clear here: the PCs (six, 9th-level or equivalent) have probably already had an encounter or two. They're underground, far from home, don't speak the language, relying on eating whatever they catch, possibly responsible for a couple dozen slaves at this point, and likely not in the best of condition. Even if they rested for the night and got their spells and 1-3 hp back, they haven't shaved and they had to piss behind a stalagmite. Then they hit the river.

It's a broad river, and a deep river, and a relatively fast-moving river, and it's all fucking dark. They can either pay up (assuming that they don't insult the insane fishman for not speaking Undercommon, who would presumably go into a beserker rage and angrily scull towards them for six rounds), or fight. And if they fight, he is nominally 13th-level equivalent...but there's only one of him (minus the giant fish). If they get him on dry ground, they have the numbers. Some of them might just want to do it for shits and giggles.

I think, as much as anything, the physical challenges are more important than MalkFish here. Because a canny Mister Cavern will just let the PCs fucking rot on their side of the river and try to figure out how to get across. Good luck with that! (Also, it occurs to me that I have no idea if the Svartjet is freshwater, brackish, or brine.)

>When Thoopshib sculls the barge, it will take him only 6 rounds to travel directly across to moor the barge in the opposite bank cove. If others scull the craft, it will take twice that long, they will move diagonally downstream, and there will be no possibility of mooring the barge, so it will be carried off downstream by the current after disembarkation. If he is somehow forced to take a party across, Thoopshib will leap into the Svartjet in midstream, taking the sculling oar with him, and seek his giant gar friend. The barge will be carried downstream at a rate of 9 miles per hour. There is 70% chance that the vessel will ground at hex B224, but failing that it will continue at an average speed of 5 miles per hour all the way to the Sunless Sea. Travel upriver in the barge is impossible. It is not possible to walk along the riverside.

This is, basically, the classic "boxing" of a play area at work. Works well in a dungeon, doesn't come across as _too_ unnatural in an underground tunnel system, but can swiftly get tedious when it blocks off a lot of alternatives. The fact that the PCs have zero percent chance of speaking Undercommon is weird to me, but I guess this was before they really nailed down all the languages in AD&D.

Presuming you don't get whisked far off course down the underground river to the Sunless Sea, getting to the other shore puts you only a few miles away from Encounter Area A2-31, which is the big one for this module. Like, literally the entire rest of the module. The eponymous Shrine of the Kuo-Toa. I have no idea why the Shrine is four miles from the nearest river and away from the major trade routes - you would think the Deep Gnomes at least would have built a working ferry instead of relying on a raging, hormonal fish-man to get them across - but there you have it. So next post is the big one!
